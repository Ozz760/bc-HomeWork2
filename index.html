        <p>
            My name is Oscar Silva. The most significant challenge I’ve faced is being born into a family of immigrants who
            were previously undocumented and growing up in the rough neighborhoods of east Oceanside. Modern day Oceanside
            is divrse, thriving community that has overcome a dark history of gang violence. The east side of
            Oceanside--otherwise known as “Posole”--was for decades a hub of gang activity, drug dealing, and violence for
            many people who look like me. It is also a neighborhood that many immigrant families like mine call home. Coming
            from an immigrant background, it can often seem that the deck is stacked against you. As a result, I learned to
            live in the shadows in constant fear of not only the gang members in my neighborhood, but also of being taken
            away from the nation that holds my American dream. I could have easily chosen the route of illegal activity that
            was so well established in my community, but I didn’t--I always knew I could find another route to achieve my
            goals. Although my family has faced numerous challenges over the years, we never lost sight of the goal to not
            only live in America but thrive here. I would go out of my way to avoid those gang “sets” that enticed so many
            others who didn’t have the best start in life. It may have put an invisible target on my back, but I still
            managed to live my life away from the gang activity.
