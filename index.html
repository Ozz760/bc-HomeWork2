        My name is Oscar Silva. The most significant challenge I’ve faced is being born into a family of immigrants who
        were previously undocumented and growing up in the rough neighborhoods of east Oceanside. Modern day Oceanside
        is divrse, thriving community that has overcome a dark history of gang violence. The east side of
        Oceanside--otherwise known as “Posole”--was for decades a hub of gang activity, drug dealing, and violence for
        many people who look like me. It is also a neighborhood that many immigrant families like mine call home. Coming
        from an immigrant background, it can often seem that the deck is stacked against you. As a result, I learned to
        live in the shadows in constant fear of not only the gang members in my neighborhood, but also of being taken
        away from the nation that holds my American dream. I could have easily chosen the route of illegal activity that
        was so well established in my community, but I didn’t--I always knew I could find another route to achieve my
        goals. Although my family has faced numerous challenges over the years, we never lost sight of the goal to not
        only live in America but thrive here. I would go out of my way to avoid those gang “sets” that enticed so many
        others who didn’t have the best start in life. It may have put an invisible target on my back, but I still
        managed to live my life away from the gang activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I have a set goal in life to become a venture capitalist, a profession that few Mexican Americans hold.
        Perhaps counterintuitively, my academic achievements have benefited greatly from the challenges I have faced and
        overcome. No matter what subject, project, or extracurricular activity comes my way, I know I will excel in all
        aspects because I rise above and persevere. Earning a 4.0 Grade Point Average, participating in a Global
        Solutions program are all the manifestations of my ambition. Recently I had the opportunity to volunteer for a
        community advocacy organization, Hazel’s Army, that fights for at-risk and marginalized communities through
        legislative advocacy and community education.
